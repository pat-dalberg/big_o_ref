There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Who it's for ##
  The Big O Notation Reference App is for engineers and students that want a quick way to
  reference and compare the running time of algorithms in big O notation.   
  

## What it does ##
  Big O Notation Reference App provides a web and mobile app that lets users look up and compare
  orders of big O notation. This is highly usefull for computer science students and software
  engineers.  
  

## Why it does it ##
  Big O notation is a difficult concept to understand, and this app helps by providing 
  information about the orders simply, easily and in multiple formats.

## How to Get Started ##
  Go to (url) or download the app. Select the big O order you want to know more about. Obtain
  knowledge. Do things. Have smart conversations about the time complexity of algorithms.

## Customer Quote ##
  Jay Random - I struggled with big O notation, and other engineers made fun of me when I didn't
  know the difference between constant time and quadratic time. Thanks to the Big O Notation Reference App I laugh at them now, then I beat them up and take their lunch money.
